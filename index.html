                            Most Americans lack the savings to stay afloat without their paychecks. Research shows that 67% of U.S. workers would find it somewhat or very difficult to meet current financial obligations if their paycheck were delayed by one week. Long term disability customers who received benefit payments have told us that the coverage prevented more than 50% of them from missing mortgage/rent payments, having to move out of their home, or missing other bills.

                            Employees can cancel their coverage at any time, just by notifying Unum. Compare that to the hassle of trying to enroll and employee who has missed open enrollment. Or the pain of talking to an employee who didn't enroll, but now can't pay the bills due to missed work after an injury or illness.

                            Not at all. In fact, auto-enroll makes enrollment easier for employers AND employees. And with Unum, you'll have all the resources you need to fulfill requirements like those set forth in the Maine legislation. Because we were able to provide input to this law, we unerstand Maine's legislation better than any other provider.
